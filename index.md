# About me
I recently finished an economics PhD at Harvard University, where I focused on applied econometrics and education, especially relating to teacher value-added.
I now develop pricing algorithms at [QuantCo](http://quantco.com).

I once successfully ingested the clear plastic thing from the top of the blender.

[My husband](http://tbenthompson.com) is really smart.
