# About me

I'm a Research Engineer at Meta, where I work on Bayesian Optimization with [BoTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch)
and [Ax](https://github.com/facebook/Ax). Previous gigs include working as a Research Scientist at Meta, focusing on experimentation;
building machine learning solutions for e-commerce and insurance at [QuantCo](http://quantco.com), where I
co-wrote [glum](https://github.com/Quantco/glum) and [tabmat](https://github.com/Quantco/tabmat); and
writing an economics PhD thesis at Harvard.

I once successfully ingested the clear plastic thing from the top of the blender.
