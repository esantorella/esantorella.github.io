# About me
I'm an economics PhD student at Harvard University. My [research]({{ baseurl }}research) focuses on the measurement of individual effects. This work has inspired a couple [projects]({{ baseurl }}projects) that I maintain on [GitHub](http://github.com/esantorella).

In the last few years I've figured out that I like writing code way more than writing papers. I expect to graduate in spring 2017 and move into the private sector to work in data science or statistical computing full-time.
