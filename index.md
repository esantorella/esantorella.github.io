# About me

I'm an economist, data scientist, and machine learning algorithm developer at [QuantCo](http://quantco.com), where I build pricing solutions.
I recently finished an economics PhD in the fields of econometrics and public economics
at Harvard University, where my fields were econometrics and public economics. I focused on
methodological issues in evaluating teacher quality.

I once successfully ingested the clear plastic thing from the top of the blender.

[My husband](http://tbenthompson.com) is really smart.
