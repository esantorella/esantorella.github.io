I'm at [Econ-ML](http://econ-neural.net/kleinberg-mullainathan.html) talking about Kleinberg, Mullainathan, and Raghavan (2016),
"Inherent Trade-Offs in the Fair Determination of Risk Scores."
They demonstrate that it is generally impossible for an algorithm
to satisfy each of three seemingly-reasonable criteria for
fairness to different groups.
