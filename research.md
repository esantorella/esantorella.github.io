My current research focuses on the detection and measurement of individual effects.

[comment]: # <p>I estimate the covariance structure of teacher effects on several 
[comment]: # outcomes: present and future test scores, present and future attendance, and
[comment]: # high school graduation. Studying the covariance matrix of teacher effects reveals
[comment]: # the magnitude of teacher effects on each outcome 
[comment]: # and the relationship between teacher effects on different outcomes
[comment]: #     while sidestepping the need to estimate individual teacher effects.</p>
[comment]: # 
[comment]: # <p>Although teachers have substantial effects on test
[comment]: # scores four years in the future, these effects are not highly correlated with
[comment]: # teacher effects on same-year test scores, implying that the effects of having a
[comment]: # teacher who raises same-year test scores fades out quickly, and short-term 
[comment]: # teacher effects on test scores do not predict long-term effects well. Teacher
[comment]: # effects on same-year attendance, by contrast, are highly predictive of longer-term
[comment]: # attendance. Teacher effects on test scores are only weakly correlated with 
[comment]: # teacher effects on attendance. Teachers who are one standard deviation above
[comment]: # average at improving high school graduation increase graduation rates by 2% to
[comment]: # 8%, although graduation data is limited.

[comment]: # 
[comment]: # <p>Although a large volume of research has investigated whether
[comment]: # the identification assumptions of value-added models hold, the statistical
[comment]: # properties of these estimators are less studied, especially in finite
[comment]: # samples. In the second chapter, I survey several popular value-added
[comment]: # estimation procedures. I discuss conditions under which models are identified,
[comment]: # clarify whether estimators are consistent or unbiased, and derive standard
[comment]: # errors. I also develop a maximum (quasi-)likelihood estimator. I investigate
[comment]: # the bias and precision of different estimators in Monte Carlo data and check
[comment]: # whether estimators give similar answers in real data. My focus is on the 
[comment]: # portion of variance that is due to variation in teacher quality, but I also
[comment]: # discuss individual-specific estimates, and ask whether different procedures
[comment]: # give highly correlated estimates of teacher effects, and whether a procedure
[comment]: # can reliably identify teachers in the bottom 2%. Although I use the language
[comment]: # of teachers, classrooms, and students for clarity, these results extend
[comment]: # readily to different settings.

[comment]: # 
[comment]: # <p>We use several value-added estimators to study a
[comment]: # question relevant to political economy: How much agency do individual 
[comment]: # bureaucrats have to impact local economic performance? We study
[comment]: # high-ranking bureaucrats in the Indian Administrative Service, 
[comment]: # India's national bureaucracy. These bureaucrats, District Collectors,
[comment]: # District Collectors, who are quasi-randomly assigned to manage the 
[comment]: # bureaucracy of an Indian district and often transfer to different districts
[comment]: # in the same state. This setting presents econometric challenges, since we
[comment]: # have relatively few observations and high-dimensional covariates. By randomly
[comment]: # permuting bureaucrat names, we show that value-added estimators have strong
[comment]: # finite-sample biases in this setting. Point estimates suggest that variance in
[comment]: # District Collector quality accounts for substantial variance in project
[comment]: # completion and night light intensity. However, randomization inference shows
[comment]: # that our estimates are in fact insignificant.
