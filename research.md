My current research focuses on the detection and measurement of individual effects.

<li><p><b>Multi-Dimensional Teacher Effects</b> <a href='/public/full_chapter1.pdf'>(working paper)</a></p>

<p>I estimate the covariance structure of teacher effects on several 
outcomes: present and future test scores, present and future attendance, and
high school graduation. Studying the covariance matrix of teacher effects reveals
the magnitude of teacher effects on each outcome 
and the relationship between teacher effects on different outcomes
    while sidestepping the need to estimate individual teacher effects.</p>

<p> Teachers have substantial effects on high school graduation, and on test
    scores and attendance four years in the future. Students of a teacher who 
    is one standard deviation above average at improving graduation rates
    are 5 percentage points more likely to graduate high school.
Although teacher quality is an important determinant of graduation rates and of
    future test scores and attendance, long-term effects
    cannot be predicted well by short-term effects. For example, even if teacher effects
    on contemporaneous outcomes were perfectly measured, they would only
    explain about 3% of the variance in teacher effects on high school graduation.
    My results also suggest that teacher effects on attendance could be an
    important supplement to score-based measures of teacher value-added.
    Teachers who improve attendance tend to improve high school graduation
    rates. However, teacher effects on attendance are only weakly correlated
    with effects on test scores. I also use Principal Components Analysis to show
    that the correlation matrix of teacher effects can be well-represented by
    three easily interpretable components.</p>

<li><p><b>Which Value-Added Estimator Works Best and When?</b> <a href='/public/full_chapter2.pdf'>(working paper)</a></p>

<p>Value-added estimators have been extensively used to study 
teachers and other groups.
These estimators describe how dispersed teachers (or others)
are in their effects on an outcome: for example, variation in
teacher quality contributes to about 1% of the variance in student test scores.
Value-added modeling is also used by school districts
to rank teachers and make firing decisions. 
Although a large volume of research has investigated whether and when
the identification assumptions of value-added models hold 
the statistical properties of these estimators are less studied,
especially in finite samples.
For example, standard errors and hypothesis tests are often 
unavailable, and parameter estimates can be badly biased even when
identified.</p>

<p>In this project, I survey several popular value-added estimation procedures
and study their statistical properties. I discuss conditions under which
models are identified, clarify whether estimators are consistent or unbiased,
and derive asymptotic, parametric standard errors. 
I also develop a maximum (quasi-)likelihood estimator. I 
confirm theoretical predictios about bias in Monte Carlo data and
check whether estimators give similar answers in real data.</p>

<p>For clarity, I often use terminology relating to teachers and classrooms
since value-added modeling is most used for studying teachers. However,
these results extend readily to different settings.</p>

<li><p><b>Bureaucrat Value Added: The Effect of Individual Bureucrats on Local Economic Outcomes in India</b>, 
with Jonas Hjort and Gautam Rao. Working paper coming soon! </p>


<p>We use several value-added estimators to study a
question relevant to political economy: How much agency do individual 
bureaucrats have to impact local economic performance? We study
high-ranking bureaucrats in the Indian Administrative Service, 
India's national bureaucracy. These bureaucrats, District Collectors,
District Collectors, who are quasi-randomly assigned to manage the 
bureaucracy of an Indian district and often transfer to different districts
in the same state. This setting presents econometric challenges, since we
have relatively few observations and high-dimensional covariates. By randomly
permuting bureaucrat names, we show that value-added estimators have strong
finite-sample biases in this setting. Point estimates suggest that variance in
District Collector quality accounts for substantial variance in project
completion and night light intensity. However, randomization inference shows
that our estimates are in fact insignificant.
