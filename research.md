My current research focuses on the detection and measurement of individual effects. You can read more about the code that powers it [here]({{ baseurl }}projects).

<li><p><b>Teacher Effects on Student Behavior</b>: Working paper coming soonish!</p>


<p>As large school districts adopt test-based teacher evaluation metrics and parents protest the increasing use
of standardized tests, it is timely to ask whether teacher evaluation systems should expand the use of
quantitative measures not based on test scores. I examine the
magnitude and short-term consequences of teacher effects on student attendance. I find that teachers
have moderate effects on attendance: A teacher who is one standard deviation above average improves the 
average student's attendance by 0.55 days in elementary school and 0.74 days in middle school.  Teacher effects on
attendance  are  nearly  uncorrelated  with  teacher  e ects  on  test  scores.   Teacher  effects  on
attendance appear to be moderately persistent, fading out to 17% to 98% of their original size after
four years.</p>

<li><p><b>Bureaucrat Value Added: The Effect of Individual Bureucrats on Local Economic Outcomes in India</b>, 
with Moya Chin, Jonas Hjort, and Gautam Rao. </p>


<p>We investigate the influence of individual officers in the Indian Administrative Service on local economic activity. 
We use two distinct methods from labor and education economics:  the AKM approach,
which has traditionally been used to estimate the share of variation in wages that is due to firms and
workers; and the value-added approach, which has traditionally been used to estimate teachers' effects
on students' test scores.</p>
